# 1st dataset -> http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality
# The Wine Quality Dataset involves predicting the quality of white wines on a scale given chemical measures of each wine.
# 
# 2nd dataset -> https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html
# The Breast Cancer Dataset involves predicting the probability of positive case of breast cancer with given attributes.
# 
# Problem:
# A classification problem is when the output variable is a category (basically 'yes' or 'no').
# A classification model attempts to draw some conclusion from observed values.
# Given one or more inputs a classification model will try to predict the value of one or more outcomes.
# 
# Usage:
# python classification.py `test_size`
